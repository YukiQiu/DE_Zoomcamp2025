# **Problem Description**

For this project, I'm using the Million Music Dataset to get some insights and show them with visualization. 

## **DataSet Introduction**

This Million Song Dataset contains millions of songs, which includes the length of each song, release date, singer, and so on.

Here is the source data link:http://millionsongdataset.com/

I randomly selected 100,000 records from the source data in the project since the source dataset was too large. 

The questions I'm trying to figure out using this subset are below:
1. What is the average duration among these 100,000 songs?
2. Which song has the longest duration, by which singer?
3. Which year has the most songs been released?
